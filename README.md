## Project Documentation:

### "Site Designer" and "Quick Facts" Sections:

The first part of my project that I built were the "Site Designer" and "Quick Facts" (formerly "Hobbies") sections. Being that I was a first-time web designer and had no idea what I was doing, these sections were seminal to my understanding of basic HTML and soon later, basic CSS.

### "Gallery" Section:

This section was personally a challenge for me because up to this point, I was unfamiliar with styling images in CSS. Around the time I made this section was also when I added color to my website and styled my all of my headers/subheaders.

### "Blog Topic" Section:

This section started out originally as a meaningless "litipsum" article, but has turned into so much more. It was originally created so that I could properly visualize and modify my media states, but recently I've added my own "Blog Post" summarizing the usage and arguing for the usefulness of variable fonts a typographical asset.
